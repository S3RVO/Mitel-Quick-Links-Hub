To make a new link along with all of its tabs....

In the Main HTML file:

Create the new link in the sidebar
   give it an id of [linkname]-link, with href=#link name
   

copy and paste from another full content div
   add the "hide" class to the outer div, and an id of [linkname]-content

edit the UL tab names so that the first tab has href="#home-[productname]
   same goes for each tab after, but add it to the menu1, 2, 3, etc href strings, e.g. menu1-[productname] and so on


for each of the tab content divs...
   give the 1st nested div an id of "home-[productname]"
   name the H3 tag accordingly
    <!-- Slideshow -->
    if the tab info has a slideshow, this is where it should go now, after the H3.
    make sure for each open div display container that you add the product name as a class, coupled with mySlides class

    make sure the remaining tabs also have the id of menu1-[productname], menu2-[productname], etc.



In the main JS file:

create new event handler for the new category link by copying one of the previously made ones first
